1. Implemented Entity Framework for database integration.
2. Implemented CRUD Operations, N-Tier Architecure, and Repository patterns.
	a. N-Tier Architecture 
		- modularity and scalability.
		- separation of concerns (SoC).
		- reusability.
		- flexibility and maintainability.
	
	b. Repository Pattern
		- abstraction of Data Access Logic.
		- consistent querying and updating. 
		- encapsulation of data access details.
3. Authorization and Validation.
4. Created hierarchical order for the application.
		- Admin Access.
		- Customer Access.
5. Established foreign-key relationships.

In a .NET Core application, combining n-tier architecture with the repository pattern 
helps create a scalable, maintainable, and testable codebase. It simplifies development, 
improves code organization, and facilitates future modifications and enhancements.

6. ViewBag- Transfers data from the Controller to View, not vice-versa. Ideal for situations
   in which the temporary data is not in a model. It is a dynamic property taht takes advantage
   of the new dynamic features of C# 4.0. It is a wrapper around view data.

7. ViewData- It also transfers data from the Controller to View, not vice-versa.But it must be 
   type cast before use, and its life only lasts during the current http request and is null if
   redirection occurs.

8. TempData- It can be used to store data between two consecutive requests such as error messages 
   which goes away when you refresh the page.
